Hello and Welcome to PvPCraft's documentation. Some features that are still being tested may not be documented.

Prefixes default to /, // and !! but can be changed in your servers settings page.

This documentation is primarily about text commands.

## General notes

-----
By default, most permissions are unset and default to false make sure to read the permissions section to learn how to activate commands and choose who can use them.

When running commands for the bot make sure not to include **\<\>** or **[]**, they are only there to tell you what you need to edit.
Things in **\<\>** are required for the command to run while things in **[]** are optional.

## Settings & Permissions

-----

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M8z7Jofc6bU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Permissions are the cornerstone of every system of **PvPCraft** they allow you to limit commands to a specific channel,
role or user in whatever way you deem fit.

If you are familiar with linux commands this chart should be enough. Just remember more specific things inherit from less specific things.

| command  | description  | node  |
|---|---|---|
| perms set \<allow\|deny\|remove> \<node>\[ --channel \<channel>]\[ --role \<role>]\[ --user \<user>] | sets permission nodes | Discord Perm Administrator |
| perms list  |  displays a link to the website with the current permissions setup | Discord Perm Administrator  |
| perms hardreset  |  removes all user defined permissions  |  Server Owner  |
| setting | generates a link that will allow anyone with admin perms to configure part of the bot through a web ui | Admin |
  
Though few, these commands form the most powerful permissions system known to Discord. Look at another module and find a node, something like music.play
If you want to give away all commands beginning with music, you can add the wildcard *, eg: `music.*`. 
To allow a permission node for everyone in all text channels, for example enabling music for everyone in all text channels:

```
/perms set allow music.*
```

You can then constrain that a bit more by adding one of the optional adjustments onto the end of it. Let's see how it looks when we constrain the node to one channel.
```
/perms set allow music.* --channel #djs
```
In this case we allow the users to use all the music commands in the text chat `#djs` which limits the spam created by users running these commands.
Say you want to keep forceskip for your admin team though. To do this you would first deny the users the forceskip permission. Then allow it for your admin role(s).
This example builds on top of the previous channel specific permission. If you want server-wide music commands remove the `--channel #djs` from the following commands.
```
/perms set deny music.forceskip --channel #djs
```
```
/perms set allow music.forceskip --channel #djs --role @Admin
```

<br>

## Music

-----

The Music module allows you to setup the bot to play a queue of songs in a voice channel.

If the music lags I apologise in advance... There is not much that can be done about that at the moment, and really it 
boils down to more server space, which costs money. If you want to help out, the bot has a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/macdja38)
and a [Paypal](https://www.paypal.me/pvpcraftbot).

**Soundcloud and some other random websites are supported by the /play command.**

| command  | description  | node  |
|---|---|---|
| init | temporarily binds the bot to the voice channel the user is in, and the text channel the command was used in | music​.init |
| destroy | un-binds the bot from it's current voice and text channel​. | music​.destroy  |
| play \<search term \| video link \| playlist \> | plays the song or playlist in the bound channel | music​.play  |
| skip [target] | votes to skips the song at index in queue or the currently playing song | music​.voteskip  |
| skip [target] -f | force skips the song at index in queue or the currently playing song | music​.forceskip |
| pause | pauses the current song | music​.pause |
| resume | resumes the current song | music​.resume |
| list | lists the contents of the queue | music​.list |
| link | displays a link to the currently playing song | music​.link | 
| time | displays the current time into the song | music​.time |
| clear [--user \<user\>] | clears the queue, if a user is supplied only clears that user from the queue | music.clear |
| volume [volume] | if volume is provided it sets the volume, if not it displays the volume | music​.volume​.set or/and music​.volume​.list
| shuffle | shuffles the current queue | music​.shuffle |

#### Notes

##### Denying access to a voice channel

The permission node `music.initinto` can be assigned to a music channel to allow users to init the bot into that channel.
By default all users have this node so it must be expressly denied so if you want to limit the bot to one voice channel
you would use:

```
/perms set deny music.initinto
```

then you have to allow it in the **voice** channel of your choosing using

```
/perms set allow music.initinto --channel That Music Channel
```

Remember that music channels can't be mentioned so you need to type out the name Exactly.

##### Song Limit

You can also limit the number of songs a single user can queue using the numbers mechanic to the permission system.
By giving the permission node `music.songcount` a specific number you can choose who gets to queue how many songs.
For example to apply a 10 songs in queue cap to all users you can use:

```
/perms set 10 music.songcount
```

It can also be targeted at a specific group, user or/and channel the same way any permissions command can be.

<br>

## Giveaways

-----

Giveaways allow you to host giveaways on your Discord server. At the moment, only one giveaway can be hosted on each Discord server.

PvPCraft's giveaway module allows you to choose who can enter the giveaway, as well as assign roles/users of your choosing the ability
to draw.

| command  | description  | node  |
|---|---|---|
| giveaway \<enable\|disable>\[ --channel \<channel>] | enables or disables the giveaways. If no channel is provided it will use the last one used, or if none has been used the channel the message was sent in​. | admin​.giveaway​.setup |
| gclear | clears all entries | admin​.giveaway​.clear  |
| gcount | counts all entries | admin​.giveaway​.count  |
| gdraw [count] | draws one or more winners | admin​.giveaway​.draw  |
| enter |  enters a giveaway  |  giveaway​.enter  |

<br>

## Moderation

-----

Moderation module, mod log was moved into feeds, this is now just purge, to disable the old one use `/setlog disable`.

| command  | description  | node  |
|---|---|---|
| purge \[count]\[ --user \<user>]\[ --before \<message id>]\[ --after \<message id>][-d] | purges the text channel of messages | moderation​.tools​.purge |


If used the -d flag will drop messages purged using the command instead of logging them.

<br>

## Feeds Manager

-----

This is similar to the permissions system but for events like Warframe alerts and/or moderation log events.

| command  | description  | node  |
|---|---|---|
| feeds \<start\|stop> \<feed node>\[ --channel \<channel>] | enables or disables a specific feed within a channel. | feeds​.manage |
| find \<node> | checks where a certain node goes | feeds​.find  |

<br>

### Available feeds
<!--
| feed node | description | permission node |
| --- | --- | --- |
| moderation​.message​.deleted | Logs message deletes | msglog​.whitelist​.message​.deleted | 
| moderation​.message​.updated | Logs message edits | msglog​.whitelist​.message​.updated |
| moderation​.channel​.created | Logs channel creation | |

| moderation​.voice​.leave | Logs voice leaves | |
| moderation​.user | Logs user changes | |

        <td>Logs voice leaves</td>
        <td>msglog.whitelist.voice.leave</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

So for example once you have allowed yourself the permissions node required (`feeds.manage`, see the permissions section at the top) you can run the following command to log just users joining voice.

```
/feeds start moderation.voice.join
```

Which will then be logged into the text channel the command was run in. If you want to log multiple similar events a * can be used to reduce the commands required. For example to log all message events you can use.

```
/feeds start moderation.message.*
```

Be warned that unlike permissions you can't start moderation.* then stop moderation.voice in order to get everything but voice, with feeds everything but voice must be started.
Also if you have given yourself * you will have to deny yourself the white-list nodes for message deletes and edits if you want your own messages to be logged when they are deleted.

<br>

## Ranks

-----

#### Requirements
The **PvPCraft** bot must have a role that is higher than the rank you want it to add to users and it must have the 
Discord permission **Manage Roles**.

#### Notes:

If a rank is added with the **visible name** of joinrole it will not be visible on the `/rank list` output and it will
be added to users as they join the Discord server.

The **visible name** of a rank is the label for the rank that is visible to the users running /list or /rank join.

| command | description  | node  |
|---|---|---|
| rank add \<visible name> --role \<mention or exact name of an existing role> | adds the role from --role to the list of joinable ranks under the name of \<**visible name**> | admin​.rank​.add |
| rank remove \<visible name> | removes a rank from the list of join-able ranks |	admin​.rank​.remove |
| rank join \<visible name> | adds the user of the command to the rank they request |	rank​.join​.use && rank​.join​.\<visible name> |
| rank leave \<visible name> |	removes the user of the command from the rank they request | rank​.leave​.use && rank​.leave​.\<visible name> |
| rank list |	Lists all of the ranks | rank​.list |

#### Examples

If you want to simply allow all users to join all the ranks you've added to the rank list you can run

```
/perms set allow rank.*
```

If you want to add a rank to the list make sure you have admin.rank.add then run

```
/rank add member --role @member
```
where the first member is the label for the rank you want users to see, and the @member is a mention for or the exact 
name of the role you want added to the user when they run `/rank join member`
