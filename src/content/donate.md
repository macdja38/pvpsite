every month. At the moment it's costing a decent amount of cash  just for the server space and it's not enough
to support crystal clear music streams for all the users, their is simply too much load on the bot.
More money will help improve the quality of streaming by simply distributing it over more servers.

If you want to help the bot has a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/macdja38)
