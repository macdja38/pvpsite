### Donate

Every day more and more people start using PvPCraft on their discord servers. And that's why I need your help!

From PvPCraft's inception I've been hosting it on my own dime and investing an immense amount of work into improvements, modifications and bugfixes. However as a full-time University student I have very limited funds and time. PvPCraft is on thousands and thousands of discord servers and that requires a ton of work. Hosting costs become immense especially with custom music.

Contribution to PvPCraft will fund additional servers to bear the load, meaning higher quality streams for PvPCraft users.

Your contributions are welcome both at my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/macdja38), or alternatively through [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/pvpcraftbot).
