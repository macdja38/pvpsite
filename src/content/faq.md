### FAQ

A collection of frequently asked questions and their respective answers.
If you have any suggestions feel free to suggest them [here](https://discord.gg/p2beFQq)

#### The command I'm using is giving me no response

Check if the bot can respond by running `/help`. If you don't get a response check / try the following:
 - Have you added the bot to your Discord? If not click [here](https://invite.pvpcraft.ca)
 - Can the bot see the channel you are running the command in? If so give it a couple minutes and try again.
 If it still does not respond join [here](https://join.pvpcraft.ca) and ask @macdja38#7770 for help in 
 [#support-help](https://discord.gg/wtZDuq4)
 - Your prefix is still /, alternatively if your not sure if you changed the prefix you can try to use the bot with `@PvPCraft#0625 help`
 
If the bot does respond to `/help` but not your command try the following:
 - Make sure you've allowed yourself the permission node required to use the command.
 Permission nodes are the strings found in the permission node section to the right of the command on the docs page.
 For example for `/play` the permission node is `music.play` and to allow everyone the permission 
 to use it run `/perms set allow music.play`
